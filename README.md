# Tools

Anims

Place the executable in same dir as your executable and it will load the same assets.  Use this to debug/edit sprites and animations.

L10nScanner

Scans your code base for TRANSLATION macros and creates translation lines for them if they don't exist.  Preserves existing translations if they are there.

```
./L10nScanner.exe --input-dir <dir> --output-dir <dir2> en la fr
```
